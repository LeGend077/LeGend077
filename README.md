## About
I was a normal kid who played minecraft survival and maps on my mobile but was fascinated by the fact that it was possible to add custom items, blocks and logic using code! So first, I started web development and learned basic html, css and javascript and some amount of reactjs. With major updates to Add-On API of minecraft bedrock (1.16+), I started learning all sorts ways to develop custom things in minecraft and, from 2020 to present, I'm still doing this as a hobby. I never get bored of it so I always have motivation to learn something new!
