## About
I started web development and learned basic html, css and javascript and some amount of reactjs back in 2019 due to me discovering how websites are made. But with major updates to Add-On API of minecraft bedrock (1.16+), I started learning all sorts ways to develop custom things in minecraft and, from 2020 to present, I'm still doing this as a hobby. I never get bored of it so I always have motivation to learn something new!
